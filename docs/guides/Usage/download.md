## Download from App

Tapping on the download button from the <a href="/docs/MainMenu.png">main menu</a>
leads to the download page. From here you can download datasets
that the app can explore. For now we have provided several sample datasets.
You can provide your own by putting a dataset url in the text input bar.
The file formats that Arctic viewer supports are .tar, .tar.gz, .tgz,
.gz, and .zip. When the download begins the download button turns into a
cancel button. While downloading and while this page is open, the device will
indefinitely stay on however you may navigate to other pages if you wish.

A tag on the top right corner of a dataset means that it's already
on the device, but there's nothing stopping you from
redownloading it. Tapping on a sample dataset will supplement the url in
the input bar with a dataset title and its filesize.

## Download from Web

If you open any of the supported formats in Safari you'll
be presented an option to open the file in Arctic Viewer. Note
that Safari downloads the file first then prompts you, it does not
give any progress indicator while doing this so you may be staring
at a blank page for a bit. Best to take the url and download
it through the download page if it's a large file.

## Import from iTunes

You can sync datasets through iTunes by either adding a folder or
a supported file type and syncing it. With the device connected
to the computer, navigate to the apps section of the device and scroll down.
You'll see a list of apps that support iTunes file sharing, click on
Arctic Viewer and you'll see a list of available datasets. Drag and drop the
dataset on to the list or add it with the add button. Depending on the
dataset size it may take some time before it appears in the list. Press sync
and the datasets will be transfered. If the dataset is compressed
it will deflate it when Arctic Viewer starts up.
