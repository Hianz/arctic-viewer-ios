You can update or revert the underlying version of Arctic Viewer
from the about page. Tapping on the input bar will bring up a
picker wheel where you can select the version you want to use.
When download is pressed there is no way to cancel, it's
a small package and will download and and overwrite old files very
quickly. You can always re-download a newer version.

Arctic Viewer does not automatically download new versions, nor
automatically fetch a list of available versions. Periodically press
the refresh button to get a new list of versions.
