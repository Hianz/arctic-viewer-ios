This is the opening view of the app. There is a list of datasets you've downloaded
and two navigational buttons.
These buttons take you to either of the following sections:

- <a href="/docs/Download">Download page</a>
- <a href="/docs/Update">About page</a>

Tapping on a dataset in the list will bring you to the
<a href="/docs/Explore">Explore page</a>.
To delete a dataset, swipe left and tap delete.
