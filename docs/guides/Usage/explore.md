Tapping on a dataset from the <a href="/docs/MainMenu">main menu</a> brings
up a dataset on this page. You can interact with the dataset as you would from
a web browser. A lightweight server runs on you're phone when this view is open,
if your device is connected to a WiFi network, you can connect
to it from another computer or device that is also on the same network.
The address for this server is available from the action button in
the navigation bar.

## Fullscreen

Quickly shaking the device twice will toggle a fullscreen view. Fullscreen is
off by default. In Arctic Viewer's settings page in the Settings app, there's
a switch which enables fullscreen on by default.
