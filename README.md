# Arctic Viewer

A native iOS wrapper and data manager for [Tonic In Situ Data Viewer](https://github.com/Kitware/in-situ-data-viewer). For iPad and iPhone, requires at least iOS 8.

## Setup

The project depends on three [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) which are marked in the `Podfile`. 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Kitware/Arctic-Viewer.git
$ cd Arctic-Viewer
$ pod install
$ open -a XCode ArcticViewer.xcworkspace
```
Because we're using CocoaPods always make sure you're openeing the `.xcworkspace` and **not** the `.xcodeproj`

## Todo

- Anticipate Swift 2.0 and iOS9
