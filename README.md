# Arctic Viewer

A native iOS wrapper and data manager for [Tonic Arctic Viewer](https://github.com/Kitware/arctic-viewer).
For iPhone and iPad, requires iOS 8 or newer.

## Setup

The project depends on three [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) which are marked in the `Podfile`.
You can quickly install CocoaPods with `$ sudo gem install cocoapods`.


```
$ git clone https://github.com/Kitware/arctic-viewer-ios.git 
$ cd arctic-viewer
$ pod install
$ open -a XCode ArcticViewer.xcworkspace
```
Because we're using CocoaPods always make sure you're openeing the `.xcworkspace` and **not** the `.xcodeproj`

## Todo

- Anticipate Swift 2.0 and iOS9
